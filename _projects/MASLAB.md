**M**obile **A**utonomous **S**ystems **LAB**oratory is a 10 week fast-tracked competition held at MIT where teams compete to create an autonomous robot that compete against each-other.

This was my first introduction into autonmous robotics -- both from a mechanical and programming side. My role was focused on implementing a mechanical design used to collect blocks on the robot in two seperate resovoirs and deploy them before the final buzzer of the competition.

Our robot was able to sucessfully stack blocks and score points. After the competition our team continued working together and competed in MakeMIT, placing in one of the top teams.
