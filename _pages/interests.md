### Weightlifting
I have been lifting weights for a few years now. In the past I approached it haphazardly, learning through the internet and others I trained with. Within the past year I've decided to focus more on learning the science between progressive overload, adaptation, and how that fits into a framework which can make any athlete better. During quaratine, when home gym euipment prices peaked, I built a squat rack to continue training even when the gyms closed. I'm always interested in talking about weightlifting and weightlifting scienec.
