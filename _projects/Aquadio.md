*Aquadio* is my college senior thesis. It was designed to fit with my interests and something I wanted to spend more time on was **how to structure** and **effectively run** a startup developing a new product. The main goals of *Aquadio* were:

+ Design a product by conducting market research, interviews, and trials with end users
+ Coordinate and with a team of 10 engineers, across disciplines, to radpidly develop a product to bring to market
+ Complete mechanical design thesis for MIT Mechanical Engineering to graduate

The product we developed was a tool to help competitive swim teams train smarter. It provided real time statistics on performance and stored information between practices for induviduals and coaches to review. It went through three major iterations before arriving at the final design:

An important aspect of our product we wanted to get right was the **form**. Because this device was supposed to be worn by swimmers every practice we needed to make it not only useful, but also **comfortable**, **easy to wear**, and **durable**. We went through three iterations of form factors and pool testing to arrive at our final design. Form tree below:

The project was a sucess and we were able to showcase our work at the [MIT SLoan Sports Analysitcs Conference](http://www.sloansportsconference.com/) in 2018. We were offered a research position to continue working on Aquadio at MIT, but decided as a team to continue our career plans after graduation instead.
