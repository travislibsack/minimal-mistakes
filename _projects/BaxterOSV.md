The COVID-19 crisis in 2020 posed an extreme threat to under-developed countries. Wite their lack of medical equipment and infrastructure needed for ventilators, they were going to be stuck without the equipment needed to effectively fight the dieases. The Baxter Open Source Ventilator (BaxterOSV) was designed to work in under-developed countries with limited access to medical supply chains. The design utilizes **off-the-shelf components** and a design that **creates its own pressure** to ventilate patients, not needing expensive hospital infrastructure.

This design participated in the [CoVent-19 Challange](https://www.coventchallenge.com/) run my Massachusetts General Hospital in Spring 2020 and made it as one of the **7 finalists** to the final round of the competition!

BaxterOSV performed more consistently each breath when compared to industry products. A ventilator technician we partnerd with to test our system said:

> â€œConsistently we were able to safely administer ventilations to the patient, we were able to change the settings to accommodate any reasonable parameters, and do so safely, quickly, easily, and achieve results that were... surprisingly similar to our full anesthesia machine"

The validation for our system was done measuring the output with external sensors and comparing aginst our settings. Below is an example of a breath our ventilator was able to produce:
