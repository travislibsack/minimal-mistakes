RoboGoby was a 3-year endeavour that involved **starting a company**, **applying for and recieving grants**, and most importantly **designing and building** a semi-autonomous underwater vehicle. 

The idea that started RoboGoby was the possibility of creating an inexpensive submersible for local researchers, dam builders, and shipyards to do work they couldn't do. It either added functionality to their work or took the place of a human diver in riskier situations, such as dam inspections.

I started this project with a few friends from high school (2013) as a side project in one of our technology classes. Over the next couple of summers we refined the design and presented our ideas at *[Bigelow Labs](https://www.bigelow.org/)*, *[The Gulf of Maine Research Institute](https://www.gmri.org/)*, *[UMaine Business School](https://umaine.edu/business/https://umaine.edu/business/)*, and *[Princeton's Tiger Launch](https://www.tigerlaunch.com/)*. After recieving a grant from both the*Maine Learning Technology Initiate (MLTI)* and *UMaine's Business School* we developed a working prototype we wanted to show off our design and raise more funding. 

The submersbile is 4ft long, capable of 6 DOF, and has video streaming capabilities. Version 2 of the submerisble is below, along with a promotional video made in 2015:

After 2015 RoboGoby was postponded due to lack of funding.
