Wonder Fort was designed to inspire incoming MIT Freshman to see the impact engineering can have in the real world -- not only was it a massive strucutre, but it was constructed and designed by current MIT students!

The strucutre itself went through a few iterations and approval with MIT's architects and engineers before construction.

As project lead I worked with my team to devleop a project booklet -- this book was full of the fort desgins and usable by anyone on the team. It helped keep construction organized and efficient, finishing after 3 days.
