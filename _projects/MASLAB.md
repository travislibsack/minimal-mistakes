**M**obile **A**utonomous **S**ystems **LAB**oratory is a 10 week fast-tracked competition held at MIT where teams compete to create an autonomous robot that compete against each-other.

This was my first introduction into autonmous robotics and the mechanical design needed to account for this.

By the competition our robot was able to sucessfully autonomously stack blocks and the mechanical systems performed as expected! After the competition our team continued working together and competed in MakeMIT, placing in one of the top teams.
