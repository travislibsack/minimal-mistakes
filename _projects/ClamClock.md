ClamClock was started  with two objectives: 

1. Create a **marketable** product. Previously I had focused entirely on the engineering and needed practice creating a marketable product.
2. Create a and **mass-manufacture** an electronics kit to teach middle schoolers how to solder & program

The engineering design took three design cycles to come to a finished project. Most of this involved the PCB design of the clock.

After completeing the design we needed to raise money and excitement -- our product needed to be marketable! To do this we started our own [KickStarter Project](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1773610279/clamclock-a-diy-binary-timekeeper) and raised over $3000, reaching 51 backers around th world. For our Kickstart campaign we made this introduction to our product:

And finally an example of ClamClock keeping time:
