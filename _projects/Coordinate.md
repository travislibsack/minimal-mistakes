Coordinate was designed to help search and rescue (SAR) teams coordinate resources and increase the efficiency of early search coverage, helping with over 50,000+ SAR missions that happen in the US each year. Using a combination of GPS and radio it creates a mesh network and a centralized base station. 

As mechanical lead on for this project my role was focused on designing and manufacturing the physical aspects of Coordinate. Here are some snapshots of the handheld devices we designed:

This class acted as one of my Senior Capstone Projects at MIT in the Fall of 2017.
