### Weightlifting
I have been lifting weights for a few years now. In the past I approached it haphazardly, learning through the internet and others I trained with. Within the past year I've decided to focus more on learning the science of progressive overload, adaptation, and how it fits into a scientified framework used to make athletes better. During quaratine, when home gym euipment prices peaked, I built a squat rack to continue training even when the gyms closed. I'm always interested in talking about weightlifting and weightlifting science.

### Van Life (Toyota 1987 Van)
I had the opportunity to work on my own [van build](https://www.google.com/search?q=van+build&rlz=1C1GCEA_enUS812US812&oq=van+build&aqs=chrome.0.69i59j0l5j69i60l2.923j0j9&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8) during COVID-19 quaratine. It was a fun way to pass the time and allowed me and my girlfriend to travel a little during lockdown.
